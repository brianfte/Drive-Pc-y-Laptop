A theme consists of a file named **colors.json** and a directory named
**img**. The file must have the following format:

```json
{
    "dark":   ["#282C34", "#282C34"],
    "grey":   ["#ABB2BF", "#ABB2BF"],
    "light":  ["#ffffff"  "#ffffff"],
    "text":   ["#282C34", "#282C34"],
    "focus":  ["#E06C75", "#E06C75"],
    "color1": ["#C678DD", "#C678DD"],
    "color2": ["#E06C75", "#E06C75"],
    "color3": ["#61AFEF", "#61AFEF"],
    "color4": ["#98C379", "#98C379"]
}
```
The **img** directory must have this content:
- bar1.png
- bar2.png
- bar3.png
- bar4.png

You can reuse the images from a theme that's already available here and change
the colors to create your own theme.
